# Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz

## Overview

This project is part of the **freeCodeCamp Accessibility Certification** course. The goal of the project is to build an accessible quiz webpage that demonstrates various accessibility tools and design best practices. The quiz is designed to ensure that people with disabilities, such as those using screen readers or those with limited mobility, can use the site effectively.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn and implement key accessibility principles, including:

- **ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) Attributes**: Making dynamic content accessible to users with disabilities.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ensuring the webpage can be navigated easily with the keyboard.
- **Semantic HTML**: Using appropriate HTML tags to make the content more accessible.
- **Design Best Practices**: Making the webpage user-friendly for all individuals, including those with visual, auditory, and mobility impairments.

## Features

- **Accessible Form Elements**: The quiz form is built with proper labeling and structure to ensure it's screen reader-friendly.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: The webpage supports easy navigation using the keyboard, with clear focus management for interactive elements.
- **ARIA Roles and Properties**: The quiz uses ARIA attributes, such as `aria-labelledby` and `role="region"`, to improve the accessibility of the page.
- **Responsive Layout**: The design is fully responsive, ensuring the quiz works on different screen sizes, from mobile devices to desktops.
